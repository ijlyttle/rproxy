Description: For many developers who work in corporate environments, dealing
  with the proxy is a dreaded, ongoing struggle. Many system libraries use
  the 'cURL' convention; environment-variables http_proxy and no_proxy
  are used to determine, for a given URL, which, if any, proxy to use. Other
  system libraries may not implement completely the 'cURL' convention; this 
  package is designed to help you with these situations.
